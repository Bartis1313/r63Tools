My frosbite dumper for FB3, server | client

Has:
- entity iteration for fb3 (with memory view)
- typeinfo view and dump
- resources view
- fairfight wrapper (manual)
- disable pb drops (because it's crap)

Currently supports only x64, bf3 had different ent iteration
TODO: apply server resources live instead of on roundend + possible config
