My frosbite dumper for FB3/FB2, server | client
For client you need to change offsets
For latest fb3, typeinfo needs more resolving (hashing etc...)

Has:
- entity iteration for fb2 / fb3 (with memory view)
- typeinfo view and dump
- resources view
- fairfight wrapper (manual only fb3)
- disable pb drops (because it's crap)

TODO: apply server resources live instead of on roundend + possible config
